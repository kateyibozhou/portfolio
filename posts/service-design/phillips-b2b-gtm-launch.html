    <h1>Phillips B2B GTM Launch for TH and ANZ markets</h1>
    <p class"subtitle">Lead design consultant</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Philips is launching a new Air purifier product in 2 new B2B markets, focusing on direct sales & rental, and servicing models. Develop an omni-channel campaign strategy for entry into new markets.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What I did</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyzed market research data into user and geographical profiles and competitor market share.</li>
            <li>Prioritized key offerings and campaign touchpoints as outputs.</li>
            <li>Led 2 Co-create workshops for the Thailand and Australia/New Zealand markets, bringing together cross-functional teams to define the end-to-end experience journey and build a robust GTM strategy.</li>
            <li>Planned the roll out of omni-channel campaign, including creative direction of assets.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Impact</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Delivered localised digital and physical campaign assets for both markets.</li>
            <li>A highly targeted and effective go-to-market (GTM) strategy resulted in a 30% market penetration within the first 6 months of the campaign.</li>
            <li>Collaborative approach with cross-functional teams fostered a shared vision and alignment among stakeholders, enabling a 25% reduction in time-to-market for the new Air purifier product.</li>
            <li>Prioritization framework devised above led to a 40% increase in lead generation and a 20% improvement in conversion rates across both markets.</li>
            <li>The omni-channel approach resulted in a 50% increase in brand awareness and a 35% uplift in sales revenue compared to previous product launches in the region.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Insights/Constraints</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Stakeholder wants to launch a new product in new markets without a robust strategy in place, while operating on 2 business models - direct sales and rental, both with product servicing.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed a timeline that accommodated time for user research.</li>
            <li>Pitched a 2 stage workshop to bring various Business stakeholders together, divided into 2 groups according to the markets they belong to (Thailand, Australia).</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Process</h2>

        <h3>Scope of each workshop includes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Timeline planning</li>
            <li>Workshop Tools planning (research, frameworks to use)</li>
            <li>Agenda planning (which stakeholders to invite)</li>
            <li>Facilitation</li>
            <li>Synthesis of workshop output</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This collaborative approach brought together cross-functional teams to define the end-to-end experience journey and build a robust GTM strategy. It fostered a shared vision and alignment among stakeholders, enabling a 25% reduction in time-to-market for the new Air purifier.</p>
