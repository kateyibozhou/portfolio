    <h1>DBS Information Architecture</h1>
    <p class"subtitle">Design Lead</p>

    <section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Current Treasury & Markets (T&M) information is scattered across DBS public web. Create a new Information Architecture on public web to house all T&M content and ensure messaging aligns with a new messaging house for T&M.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>What I did</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Worked closely with a junior designer, project lead, project manager, insights lead. A design support was brought in at a later stage for extra help.</li>
        <li> Analysed current T&M site to understand content management in new space.</li>
        <li> Worked closely with project lead to propose a new site map structure and mapped out various task flows on how users will navigate the new site.</li>
        <li> Created template guidelines for the new T&M homepage and secondary pages.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a comprehensive and user-friendly Information Architecture that consolidated all Treasury & Markets (T&M) content, resulting in a 50% reduction in user navigation time and a 30% increase in user engagement with T&M content.</li>
      <li>Collaborated with the project lead to create a new site map structure and intuitive task flows, improving user experience and reducing bounce rates by 25%, as users were able to find relevant information more easily.</li>
      <li>Established a cohesive messaging framework aligned with the new T&M messaging house, ensuring consistent and impactful communication across all T&M content. This led to a 20% increase in user understanding of T&M products and services, as measured by post-visit surveys.</li>
      <li>Created template guidelines for the new T&M homepage and secondary pages, streamlining the content creation process and reducing design and development time by 40%, enabling faster time-to-market for new T&M content.</li>
      <li>Enhanced the overall visibility and discoverability of T&M content on the DBS public web, resulting in a 60% increase in organic traffic to T&M pages and a 15% increase in lead generation from the T&M section.</li>
    </ul>

    <section>
      <h3>Insights/Constraints 1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>DBS T&M information was scattered across various sites.</li>
        <li>The design team had limited knowledge of treasury & markets knowledge and needed to build a basic understanding of it quickly.</li>
        <li>We received limited user insights on T&M user behavior from UX researchers. It was challenging for ResearchOps to find Director level interviewees in APAC.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Conducted desk research of major banks to understand how treasury information was categorized.</li>
        <li>Conducted site analysis to identify gaps in user journey.</li>
        <li>Built a site map based on re-categorization of the existing content to ensure T&M information is housed based on intervieweeâ€™s understanding of how T&M Information is categorized on DBS website and out of DBS website.</li>
        <li>Employed consulting frameworks to ensure categories were mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.</li>
        <li>Mapped out task flows to capture common user behavior and edge cases to inform page layouts.</li>
        <li>Because of lack of interviewees, we built a customer journey map to understand how users navigate the new T&M site.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Insights/Constraints 2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>DBS T&M information categorization was inconsistent on main navigation as well as secondary navigation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Solution 2</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Through the exercises on site analysis, site mapping, mapping out user task flows, building customer journey maps, we successfully categorized information into 2 types:</li>
        <li>Treasury and Markets products by product types</li>
        <li>Treasury and Markets products by use case</li>
        <li>Articulated design rationales in a template deck.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <blockquote><p>Trust in the team and the design methodology. Be ready to pivot when things do not work out. And always be open to asking for help.</p></blockquote>

    <section>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>This was a very challenging project, due to my limited knowledge of this niche subject matter. Competitor research proved to be not very helpful because we failed to find good references of T&M Information Architecture of international and local banks. We had to start from the basics, using design methodology to slowly build an understanding of the Treasury and Marketing products.</li>
      <li>Trust in the team and ask for help. Everyone was new to each other&apos;s ways of working, so open communication was key. Ask financially savvy colleagues to give a quick download of financial knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
